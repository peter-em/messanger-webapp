# messanger-webapp
**Welcome to my messanger-webapp project.**<br>
It is an instant-messaging app, which I use as a learning platform<br>for web based application development.<br>


Front-end is build with plain JavaScript with some use of jQuery.<br>
Back-end is powered by Java 8 with help of Spring Web technologies.


Server currently runs (as of version 1.2.0-RELEASE) on embedded Tomcat server.<br>
